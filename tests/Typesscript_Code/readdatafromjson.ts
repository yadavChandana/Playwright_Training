/* 
fs stands for File System.
It's a built-in Node.js module used to read, write, update, delete, 
and watch files and directories.

'utf-8' is a character encoding.
It tells Node.js to read or write the file as human-readable text (not binary).
Without it, you might get a Buffer instead of a string.

readFileSync reads a file synchronously (blocks other code until the file is read).
Takes two arguments: the file path and the encoding.

JSON.parse() takes a valid JSON string and converts it into a JavaScript object.

TypeScript notes:
- `data: string` ensures TypeScript knows the file content is a string.
- `jsonData: { [key: string]: any }` allows dynamic keys for JSON objects.
